<p>ðŸ‘‰ The user cannot advance to the next stage without completing one stage. If this is attempted, the user should be notified. </p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ If the user simply switches between completed stages without making any changes, the data they selected (back/next) should not be lost. </p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ If the user makes any changes by switching between completed stages, the data after the current stage should be reset.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ At the last stage (confirmation step), if the user does not correctly enter the required information about himself, a notification should be shown to the user and incomplete confirmation of the reservation should be prevented.</p>
